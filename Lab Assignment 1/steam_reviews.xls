76561198216458083,2026-03-01,"Thanks Valve for doing nothing about Smurfs, amount of which in every single game only increases exponentially in every rank everyday. This game doesn't bring joy anymore, what a point of playing if you are being deprived of the opportunity to enjoy it."

76561198154437318,2026-03-01,"[b] This game saved and ruined my life at the same time. [/b] This game was like a drug to me. When i had nothing going on in life, it gave me joy and motivation to get through the day and try new things in life. On the other hand when i tried to get something done in life it held me back from doing things that needed to be done. It has truly been one of the best and the worst things i've done in my life. I can say with certainity that this game changed my life.

Best MOBA ever created (Deadlock aint officially launched yet bruv)

TL;DR - If you dont have a life, just play it. If you have a life, dont bother installing."
